    <p class="center bigfont">ACT I.</p>

    <p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>—<i>A Room, decently furnished. At <span class="stage">C.,</span> a bed, with curtains closed, at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.,</span> a door, at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;3<i>d</i>&nbsp;E.,</span> a door, at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.,</span> a chest of drawers, at back, <span class="stage">R.,</span> a window, at <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;3<i>d</i>&nbsp;E.,</span> a door, at <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.,</span> a fireplace, with mantel-piece, table and chairs, a few common ornaments on chimney-piece. <span class="name2">Cox,</span> dressed, with the exception of his coat, is looking at himself in a small looking-glass, which is in his hand.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> I’ve half a mind to register an oath that I’ll never have my hair cut again! [<i>His hair is very short.</i>] I look as if I had just been cropped for the militia! And I was particularly emphatic in my instructions to the hair-dresser, only to cut the ends off. He must have thought I meant the other ends! Never mind—I shan’t meet anybody to care about so early. Eight o’clock, I declare! I haven’t a moment to lose. Fate has placed me with the most punctual, particular, and peremptory of hatters, and I must fulfil my destiny. [<i>Knock at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;D.</span></i>] Open locks, whoever knocks!</p>

    <p class="entrance italics">Enter <span class="name2">Mrs. Bouncer,</span> <span class="stage">L.</span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Good-morning, Mr. Cox. I hope you slept comfortably, Mr. Cox?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> I can’t say I did, Mrs. B. I should feel obliged to you, if you could accommodate me with a more protuberant bolster, Mrs. B. The one I’ve got now seems to me to have about a handful and a half of feathers at each end, and nothing whatever in the middle.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Anything to accommodate you, Mr. Cox.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Thank you. Then, perhaps, you’ll be good enough to hold this glass, while I finish my toilet.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Certainly. [<i>Holding glass before <span class="name">Cox,</span> who ties his cravat.</i>] Why, I do declare, you’ve had your hair cut.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Cut? It strikes me I’ve had it mowed! It’s very kind of you to mention it, but I’m sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> conscious of the absurdity of my personal appearance already. [<i>Puts on his coat.</i>] Now for my hat. [<i>Puts on his hat, which comes over his eyes.</i>] That’s the effect of having one’s hair cut. This hat fitted me quite tight before. Luckily I’ve got two or three more. [<i>Goes in at <span class="stage">L.,</span> and returns, with three hats of different shapes, and puts them on, one after the other—all of which are too big for him.</i>] This is pleasant! Never mind. This one appears to me to wabble about rather less than the others—[<i>Puts on hat,</i>]—and now I’m off! By the bye, Mrs. Bouncer, I wish to call your attention to a fact that has been evident to me for some time past—and that is, that my coals go remarkably fast—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Lor, Mr. Cox!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> It is not the case only with the coals, Mrs. Bouncer, but I’ve lately observed a gradual and steady increase of evaporation among my candles, wood, sugar, and lucifer matches.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Lor, Mr. Cox! you surely don’t suspect me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> I don’t say I do, Mrs. B.; only I wish you distinctly to understand, that I don’t believe it’s the cat.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Is there anything else you’ve got to grumble about, sir?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Grumble! Mrs. Bouncer, do you possess such a thing as a dictionary?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> No, sir.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Then I’ll lend you one—and if you turn to the letter G, you’ll find “Grumble, verb neuter—to complain without a cause.” Now that’s not my case, Mrs. B., and now that we are upon the subject, I wish to know how it is that I frequently find my apartment full of smoke?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Why—I suppose the chimney—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> The chimney doesn’t smoke tobacco. I’m speaking of tobacco smoke, Mrs. B. I hope, Mrs. Bouncer, <i>you’re</i> not guilty of cheroots or Cubas?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Not I, indeed, Mr. Cox.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Nor partial to a pipe?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> No, sir.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Then, how is it that—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Why—I suppose—yes—that must be it—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> At present I am entirely of your opinion—because I haven’t the most distant particle of an idea what you mean.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Why the gentleman who has got the attics, is hardly ever without a pipe in his mouth—and there he sits, with his feet upon the mantel-piece—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> The mantel piece! That strikes me as being a considerable stretch, either of your imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentleman’s legs. I presume you mean the fender or the hob.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Sometimes one, sometimes t’other. Well, there he sits for hours, and puffs away into the fire-place.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Ah, then you mean to say that this gentleman’s smoke, instead of emulating the example of all other sorts of smoke, and going <i>up</i> the chimney, thinks proper to affect a singularity by taking the contrary direction?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Why—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Then, I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking of, is the same individual that I invariably meet coming up stairs when I’m going down, and going down stairs when I’m coming up!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Why—yes—I—</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> From the appearance of his outward man, I should unhesitatingly set him down as a gentleman connected with the printing interest.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Yes, sir—and a very respectable young gentleman he is.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Well, good-morning, Mrs. Bouncer!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> You’ll be back at your usual time, I suppose, sir?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Yes—nine o’clock. You needn’t light my fire in future, Mrs. B.—I’ll do it myself. Don’t forget the bolster! [<i>Going, stops.</i>] A halfpenny worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer—and be good enough to let it stand—I wish the cream to accumulate.</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>Exit at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> He’s gone at last! I declare I was all in a tremble for fear Mr. Box would come in before Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they’ve never met yet—and what’s more, they’re not very likely to do so; for Mr. Box is hard at work at a newspaper office all night, and doesn’t come home till the morning, and Mr. Cox is busy making hats all day long, and doesn’t come home till night; so that I’m getting double rent for my room, and neither of my lodgers are any the wiser for it. It was a capital idea of mine—that it was! But I haven’t an instant to lose. First of all, let me put Mr. Cox’s things out of Mr. Box’s<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span> way. [<i>She takes the three hats, <span class="name">Cox’s</span> dressing gown and slippers, opens door at <span class="stage">L.</span> and puts them in, then shuts door and locks it.</i>] Now, then, to put the key where Mr. Cox always finds it. [<i>Puts the key on the ledge of the door, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>] I really must beg Mr. Box not to smoke so much. I was so dreadfully puzzled to know what to say when Mr. Cox spoke about it. Now, then, to make the bed—and don’t let me forget that what’s the head of the bed for Mr. Cox, becomes the foot of the bed for Mr. Box—people’s tastes do differ so. [<i>Goes behind the curtains of the bed, and seems to be making it—then appears with a very thin bolster in her hand.</i>] The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain of such a bolster as this! [<i>She disappears again, behind curtains.</i>]</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> [<i>Without.</i>] Pooh—pooh! Why don’t you keep your own side of the staircase, sir? [<i>Enters at back, dressed as a Printer. Puts his head out at door again, shouting.</i>] It was as much your fault as mine, sir! I say, sir—it was as much your fault as mine, sir!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> [<i>Emerging from behind the curtains of bed.</i>] Lor, Mr. Box! what is the matter?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> Mind your own business, Bouncer!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Dear, dear, Mr. Box! what a temper you are in, to be sure! I declare you’re quite pale in the face!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> What colour would you have a man be, who has been setting up long leaders for a daily paper all night?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> But, then, you’ve all the day to yourself.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> [<i>Looking significantly at <span class="name">Mrs. Bouncer.</span></i>] So it seems! Far be it from me, Bouncer, to hurry your movements, but I think it right to acquaint you with my immediate intention of divesting myself of my garments, and going to bed.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Oh, Mr. Box!</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>Going.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> Stop! Can you inform me who the individual is that I invariably encounter going down stairs when I’m coming up, and coming up stairs when I’m going down?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> [<i>Confused.</i>] Oh—yes—the gentleman in the attic, sir.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> Oh! There’s nothing particularly remarkable about him, except his hats. I meet him in all sorts of hats—white hats and black hats—hats with broad brims, and hats with narrow brims—hats with naps, and hats without naps—in short, I have come to the conclusion, that he<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span> must be individually and professionally associated with the hatting interest.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Yes, sir. And, by the bye, Mr. Box, he begged me to request of you, as a particular favor, that you would not smoke quite so much.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> Did he? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with my compliments, that if he objects to the effluvia of tobacco, he had better domesticate himself in some adjoining parish.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Oh, Mr. Box! You surely wouldn’t deprive me of a lodger?</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>Pathetically.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> It would come to precisely the same thing, Bouncer, because if I detect the slightest attempt to put my pipe out, I at once give you warning that I shall give you warning at once.</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Well, Mr. Box—do you want anything more of me?</p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> On the contrary—I’ve had quite enough of you!</p>

    <p><span class="name">Mrs. B.</span> Well, if ever! What next, I wonder?</p>

    <p class="direction">[<i>Goes out at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.,</span> slamming door after her.</i></p>

    <p><span class="name">Box.</span> It’s quite extraordinary, the trouble I always have to get rid of that venerable female! She knows I’m up all night, and yet she seems to set her face against my indulging in a horizontal position by day. Now, let me see—shall I take my nap before I swallow my breakfast, or shall I take my breakfast before I swallow my nap—I mean, shall I swallow my nap before—no—never mind! I’ve got a rasher of bacon somewhere—[<i>Feeling in his pockets</i>]—I’ve the most distinct and vivid recollection of having purchased a rasher of bacon—Oh, here it is—[<i>Produces it, wrapped in paper, and places it on table.</i>]—and a penny roll. The next thing is to light the fire. Where are my lucifers? [<i>Looking on mantel-piece <span class="stage">R.,</span> and taking box, opens it.</i>] Now, ’pon my life, this is too bad of Bouncer—this is, by several degrees, too bad! I had a whole box full, three days ago, and now there’s only one! I’m perfectly aware that she purloins my coals and my candles, and my sugar—but I did think—oh, yes, I did think that my lucifers would be sacred! [<i>Takes candlestick off the mantel-piece, <span class="stage">R.,</span> in which there is a very small end of candle—looks at it.</i>] Now I should like to ask any unprejudiced person or persons their opinion touching this candle. In the first place, a candle is an article that I don’t require,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span> because I’m only at home in the day time—and I bought this candle on the first of May—Chimney-sweepers’ Day—calculating that it would last me three months, and here’s one week not half over, and the candle three parts gone! [<i>Lights the fire—then takes down a gridiron, which is hanging over the fireplace, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>] Mrs. Bouncer has been using my gridiron! The last article of consumption that I cooked upon it was a pork chop, and now it is powerfully impregnated with the odour of red herrings! [<i>Places gridiron on fire, and then, with a fork, lays rasher of bacon on the gridiron.</i>] How sleepy I am, to be sure! I’d indulge myself with a nap, if there was anybody here to superintend the turning of my bacon. [<i>Yawning again.</i>] Perhaps it will turn itself. I must lie down—so, here goes.

    <p><span class="name">Cox.</span> Well, wonders will never cease! Conscious of being eleven minutes and a half behind time, I was sneaking into the shop, in a state of considerable excitement, when my venerable employer, with a smile of extreme benevolence on his aged countenance, said to me—“Cox, I shan’t want you to-day—you can have a holiday.”—Thoughts of “Gravesend and back—fare, One Shilling,” instantly suggested themselves, intermingled with visions of “Greenwich for Fourpence!” Then came the Twopenny Omnibuses, and the Halfpenny boats—in short, I’m quite bewildered! However, I must have my breakfast first—that’ll give me time to reflect. I’ve bought a mutton chop, so I shan’t want any dinner. [<i>Puts chop on table.</i>] Good gracious! I’ve forgot the bread. Holloa! what’s this? A roll, I declare! Come, that’s lucky! Now, then, to light the fire. Holloa—[<i>Seeing the lucifer-box on table,</i>]—who presumes to touch my box of lucifers? Why, it’s empty! I left one in it—I’ll take my oath I did. Heydey! why, the fire <i>is</i> lighted! Where’s the gridiron? <i>On</i> the fire, I declare! And what’s that on it? Bacon? Bacon it is! Well, now, ’pon my life, there is a quiet coolness about Mrs. Bouncer’s proceedings that’s almost amusing. She takes my last lucifer—my coals, and my gridiron, to cook her breakfast by! No, no—I can’t stand this! Come out of that! [<i>Pokes fork into bacon, and puts it on a plate on the table, then places his chop on the gridiron,</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span> <i>which he puts on the fire.</i>] Now, then, for my breakfast things.

Mrs. Bouncer’s, I’ll be bound.—She thought to cook her breakfast while I was asleep—with <i>my</i> coals, too—and my gridiron! Ha, ha! But where’s my bacon? [<i>Seeing it on table.</i>] Here it is. Well, ’pon my life, Bouncer’s going it! And shall I curb my indignation? Shall I falter in my vengeance? No! [<i>Digs the fork into the chop, opens window, and throws chop out—shuts window again.</i>] So much for Bouncer’s breakfast, and now for my own!

The second, reprinted in a collection of John Maddison Morton’s plays, <i>Comediettas and Farces,</i> published in 1886 by Harper &amp; Brothers, is available through the Internet Archive at <a href="http://archive.org/details/comediettasfarce00mort">archive.org/details/comediettasfarce00mort</a>.</li>

      <p class="noindent">Variant spellings such as “trowsers,” “doating,” and “gulph,” and other inconsistencies of spelling not noted have been retained.</p>

      <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made. For example, the lists of abbreviations for exits and entrances and for relative positions on p. 4 were centered rather than coded as indented paragraphs to keep an abbreviation and the corresponding word or phrase on the same line and to prevent uneven spacing between words from line to line. In addition, stage directions printed flush right were placed on a separate line, then indented the same amount from the left margin and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>

      <p>In the text version of this etext, character titles preceding dialogue and character names in the stage directions have been rendered in all upper case letters.</p>
